## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main web application.
- `exams.md`: A complete study guide in Markdown format.
- `exams.json`: Structured data for the web application.
- `generate_markdown.py`: Script to rebuild the Markdown study guide.
- `generate_json.py`: Script to rebuild the JSON data for the website.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for data processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed on your machine.

### Run the Website Locally
To practice interactively on your computer:
1. Open your terminal in this folder.
2. Run the local server:
   ```bash
   uv run python server.py --port 8000
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

The custom server keeps question history in both browser `localStorage` and `data/history.json` on the server. If you use `python -m http.server` instead, the app still works, but history is only saved in the browser.

### Update Data
To refresh the exam data and rebuild all resources:
```bash
uv run python generate_markdown.py
uv run python generate_json.py
```

To import the public Britizen mock tests into `exams.json`:
```bash
uv run python import_britizen_tests.py
```

To remove repeated questions after importing:
```bash
uv run python remove_duplicate_questions.py
```

### Run Tests
```bash
uv run pytest
```
